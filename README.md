# ufc-stats

The goal with this project is to build comprehensive statistics about how MMA fights work, and what correlates to advantages.

UFCstats.com lists fighter stats including, height, reach, stance, age, and various other facts about a fighter.

Using these statistis and scraping it into a database we can test a couple of hypotheses.

We need to first run a few tests on the dataset, how often does a fighter win that is above 35? How often does the fighter with a longer reach win? How often does a challenger beat a reigning champion?

Of course, there are many other factors that goes into every fight, but I hope this can be the basis before launching into an algorithm that can make me some real money in the sports betting world.
